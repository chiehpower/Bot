# Wechat application
This repository will mainly relate to about bot or something small practice.

Now I upload two files about the wechat which have very basic codes to let you experience what is automatical sending messages and automatical replyed. 

Although I provided the ipynb and py files, I highly recommend you to use the jupyter, because you can choose which kind you want to play. On the other hand, you can login one time by QRcode without repeating many times.

Before you try this, you need to install some packages first by pip.
