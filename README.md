# Wechat application
This repository will relate to about bot or something small practice.

Now I upload two files of wechat which have very basic code to let you experience what is automatical sending the messages and automatical replyed. 

Although I provided the ipynb and py files, I recommend you to use the jupyter because you can choose which kind you want to play; in addition, you can login one time by QRcode without repeating many times.

Before you try this, you need to install some packages first by pip.
